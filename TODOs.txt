+ Maple bug reports: follow up/resubmit

+ Solve (∫dξ₁[-⅟ξ₁≤0]·[ξ₁≠0]·e^(-r₁²·ξ₁²·⅟2+-ξ₁²·⅟2)·ξ₁)·⅟2·⅟π and related integrals. (See div_gauss.prb).

+ While loops (L1 distance)

+ (2x+2)(x+1)  →  2(x+1)^2
  same thing for test/approximate/truncated/truncpareto.prb

+ Simplify integrals in distribution of Pareto(3,1)-1. 

+ Grouping of guards, e.g., adding Beta(2,2) distributions

+ Examples of bayesian filters: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/papers/popl05.pdf

+ Implemenent syntax to get those filters

+ Also get the filter from Benny's email


+ Make approximate/scale_kernel_simple_old.prb terminate quickly.

+ approximate/sobel.m
 - Fix matlab output, such that no 'nan's are generated.
 - Make work with signed gamma noise ( return (1 - 2*Bernoulli(0.5)) * Gamma(a,b) )

+ loop optimizations
 - e.g. approximate/sum_const.prb: extracting the loop body gives large speedup


+ Reasoning about irrational numbers.
 - e.g. in order to simplify approximate/truncated/truncgaus2.prb further

+ Simplify ∫dξ₁[-ξ₁≤0]·ξ₁·⅟e^(13·ξ₁²·⅟120) : Can help with GPS walking example from Uncertain<T>. (Instance of reasoning about quadratic irrational numbers.)

+ Simplify normalization integral for approximate/truncated/truncgaus3.prb.

+ Use gnuplot for plotting instead of octave or (low priority) build own plotter.

+ full array support

Future Work:

+ eager approximation/backtracking


- fose-icse:
 true skill benchmark:
 + integrate erf*gaussian ? (c.f. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_function#Integral_of_error_function_with_Gaussian_density_function)

- r2:
 common:
 + zero probabillity observations
  - avoid Borel paradox

 (note: we need to partition the pdf in order to avoid blow-up of runtimes due to huge arrays with independent entries.)
 (note: the examples sometimes return arrays. r2 does not actually compute the joint distribution in those cases.)
 


- bugs:
  divbyzero7.prb: returned pdf is 0 for some reason
