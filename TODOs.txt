- fose-icse:
 true skill benchmark:
 + integrate erf(linear function)
 + integrate erf*gaussian (c.f. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_function#Integral_of_error_function_with_Gaussian_density_function)

- r2:
 common:
 + negations :o)
 + categorical sampling
 + zero probabillity observations
  - avoid Borel paradox

 (note: we need to partition the pdf in order to avoid blow-up of runtimes due to huge arrays with independent entries.)
 (note: the examples sometimes return arrays. r2 does not actually compute the joint distribution in those cases.)
 



- general TODOs (not urgent):
 + Full array support
