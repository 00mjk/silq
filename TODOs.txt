MUST:

+ compare with SVE
+ compare with Indiana
+ full array support
+ non-linear constraints and assignments (assignments partly done)



Future Work:

+ eager approximation/backtracking


- fose-icse:
 true skill benchmark:
 + integrate erf*gaussian ? (c.f. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_function#Integral_of_error_function_with_Gaussian_density_function)

- r2:
 common:
 + zero probabillity observations
  - avoid Borel paradox

 (note: we need to partition the pdf in order to avoid blow-up of runtimes due to huge arrays with independent entries.)
 (note: the examples sometimes return arrays. r2 does not actually compute the joint distribution in those cases.)
 


- bugs:
  divbyzero7.prb: returned pdf is 0 for some reason
